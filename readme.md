# Namco Musem - My Arcade Mini Player - Extra Musem
Version 1.0.0.0

### What is this?
A set of Windows batch files and an Android APK to allow you to install
and run RetroArch on the Namco Museum My Arcade Mini Player, and an
entirely custom-made frontend which you can use to launch whatever
games you want using whatever RetroArch cores you want.
Granting you an Extra Museum, if you will.

Crucially, this provides a RetroArch configuration that allows you to
navigate the RetroArch frontend using the built-in controls of the
Namco Museum My Arcade Mini Player.

The original frontend and game selection are easily accessible from the
new launcher - at boot you can choose to launch RetroArch or the
original experience.

### What is this not?
A collection of ROMs or emulators - you'll have to find and add those
yourself.

Knowing how to use RetroArch is beyond scope here - the intention is
currently to get everything onto the Namco Museum My Arcade Mini Player
that you need to launch RetroArch and play games with it, but beyond
that you'll have to find information elsewhere on what to do and how to
properly use it.

## Pre-requisites
Here's what you'll need:

* A Namco Museum My Arcade Mini Player
* A USB-A to USB-micro data cable - NOT simply a charging cable!
* Android SDK Platform Tools [https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools]
* RetroArch for Android (32bit) [https://buildbot.libretro.com/stable/1.9.0/android/RetroArch_ra32.apk]
* RetroArch Cores for Android [https://buildbot.libretro.com/nightly/android/latest/armeabi-v7a/]
* ROMs of your choice to go with the cores

## Step-by-step Instructions
You only have to do this process once to install everything:

* Download the latest release [https://github.com/TerryGoodwin/NMMAMP-ExtraMuseum/releases]
* Unzip it wherever you want
* Install the Android SDK Platform Tools
 * Recommended location is `c:\android\platform-tools`
* Rename your RetroArch 32bit APK as `retroarch.apk` and put it in the `retroarch` folder
* Put any cores you want to use into `retroarch\cores`
* Put any ROMs, BIOS files etc. you need for RetroArch into `GAME-EXTRA`
* OPTIONAL: Put any thumbnails for RetroArch into `retroarch\thumbnails`
* OPTIONAL: Put any playlists for RetroArch into `retroarch\playlists`
* OPTIONAL: Look at `frontend\gamelist.json` to see how to customise the new frontend
* IMPORTANT! Make sure no other Android devices are connected!
* Make sure your device is plugged into the computer and turned on
  * IMPORTANT! Make sure it's finished booting before continuing...
* Double-click the file `run_me_first_after_readme.bat`
* Be patient as everything is installed and follow the on-screen instructions
* That's (hopefully) it!
 
You should then be able to choose from the original game selection or the new frontend
when you boot the device, then use the controls on the device to navigate the frontend
and play some games! Or, alternatively, go straight into RetroArch.

## Top Meny Choices
Press the following buttons to make your choices:

(A) Original, stock menu and games
(B) New frontend, customisable by modifying gameslist.json and running `utils/install_launcher_data.bat`
(Y) Launch directly into the RetroArch frontend

## Controls
The biggest hurdle to getting this working was figuring out how to
translate the built-inc ontrols into something that RetroArch could
understand. Fortunately the stock software prints every button press
to the log, so I could see what button codes correspond with which input
- these have been translated into the `retroarch.cfg` included with the
scripts.

### Action buttons
The four actions buttons are mapped directly to the button IDs
internally, but with cerain systems they don't have a great layout - but should be usable.

In the new frontend, press (A) to make a selection, or (B) to go back

### Coin + Reset
Quits out of games. Currently does nothing inside the new frontend

### Coin + Start
The coin button acts as the hotkey within RetroArch, so the usual
RetroArch combinations should work, but all I've really tested it with
is Start to bring up the RetroArch menu.

### Common errors

#### Couldn't start ADB
Check you've installed the Android SDK Platform Tools where you think
you did. If you didn't install them to `c:\android\platform-tools` then
you'll need to change the path at the top of each .bat file by hand to
reflect reality.

#### Root failed
This could be for a couple of reasons:

* Windows couldn't figure out the drivers for the device - see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15721778/adb-no-devices-found and follow the answer by Ant√≥nio Almeida. On my Windows 10 machine I didn't have to do anything, but on my Windows 8.1 machine I had to do that extra step.
* Your USB cable isn't transmitting data, only charge - try a different cable!

## What else can I do?
The `utils` directory contains various scripts with various functions,
explained below.

### extract_stock_roms.bat
Downloads the `GAME` directory from the device onto yoour computer.
This directory contains the stock ROMs and related frontend artwork,
and some other bits and pieces (including a full set of NeoGeo BIOS
files for some reason...)

### get_latest_retroarch_data.bat
Performs various actions in sequence - each can be ignored if you want.

Downloads `retroarch.cfg` from the device and places it at
`retroarch\retroarch.new.cfg` so you can make new changes, then push
them back to the device.

Downloads the `config` directory from the device and places it at
`retroarch\config` - this is mostly core overrides, mostly around
screen placement. Do this before making changes to those core overrides.

Downloads the `thumbnails` directory from the device and places it at
`retroarch\thumbnails`

Downloads the `playlists` directory from the device and places it at
`retroarch\playlists`

### install_launcher.bat
(Re-)Installs the launcher APK from frontend\emlauncher.apk

### install_launcher_data.bat
This is for customising the new frontend.
Performs various actions in sequence - each can be ignored if you want.

Pushes `frontend\gamelist.json` from your computer to the device.

Pushes the `frontend\screenshots` directory from your computer to the device.

Pushes the `frontend\systems` directory from your computer to the device.

Pushes the `frontend\thumbnails` directory from your computer to the device.

### install_retroarch.bat
Installs RetroArch APK from retroarch\retroarch.apk then copies over
the custom configuration file from retroarch\retroarch.cfg

### install_retroarch_data.bat
Performs various actions in sequence - each can be ignored if you want.

If you want to make manual changes to the `retroarch.cfg` this is how
you get them back on the device. NOTE! If you've made any changes ON
the device, they won't be reflected here until you run
`get_latest_retroarch_data.bat` and modify the file you get back,
otherwise you may lose changes.

Uploads `retroarch\config` to the device. Make manual changes to core
overrides and remaps and run this to get them into RetroArch. Remember
to use `get_latest_retroarch_core_overrides.bat` beforehand.

Re-copies the contents of `retroarch\cores` to your device. This is not
a sync - if you delete cores locally and then run this, they won't be
removed from your device.

Copies the contents of `retroarch\thumbnails` to your device. There's an
example directory to show the expected directory structure - use PNGs
that are the same name as your game names as defined in RetroArch's
playlists after importing the ROMs (so probably NOT the same name as
your ROMs.) See RetroArch documentation for more details.

### install_roms.bat
Re-copies the contents of `roms` and `bios` to your device.
This is not a sync - if you delete ROMs locally and then run this,
they won't be removed from your device.

Use `remove_roms.bat` to remove all ROMs and put back the ones you
want with this.

### remove_all.bat
Uninstalls everything from the device that's been put there by these
scripts and restores it to stock

### remove_all_retroarch_data.bat
Performs various actions in sequence - each can be ignored if you want.

After receiving confirmation, deletes all installed cores from the
device. Use `install_retroarch_data.bat` to put some back.

Deletes all RetroArch playlists on the device. Use `install_retroarch_data.bat` to put some back.

Deletes all RetroArch thumbnails on the device. Use `install_retroarch_data.bat` to put some back.

### remove_roms.bat
After receiving confirmation, deletes all installed ROMs from the
device. Use `install_roms.bat` to put some back.

### set_extra_launcher.bat
If you've chosen to switch back to the stock experience via the script
below (without uninstalling anything) run this to get the launcher back
so you can boot the new frontend and RetroArch.

### set_original_launcher.bat
Restore the device back to the stock experience - without removing
anything. Just run set_extra_launcher.bat if you want to get it all
back again.

## To Do
Not that much anymore!

* Add button mappings per core/system so they make more sense.
* Extend RetroArch core and ROM scripts to allow drag-and-drop of single files
* macOS version, as this is all just ADB commands anyway...
* A GUI so it's not all just ADB commands in scripts!
