# Namco Musem - My Arcade Mini Player - Extra Musem

### What is this?

A set of Windows batch files to allow you to install and run RetroArch
(or technically any sensible/valid APK) on the Namco Museum My Arcade Mini
Player by tethering it to a Windows computer. Granting you an Extra Museum,
if you will.

### What is this not?

A collection of ROMs or emulators - there's nothing included here except
scripts and an example configuration.

A way to install anything to the Namco Museum My Arcade Mini Player and let
you run it without sending commands from a computer. Not yet.

This isn't a frontend (lavish or otherwise) for a new collection of ROMs and
emulators on the Namco Museum My Arcade Mini Player - yet.

Knowing how to use RetroArch is beyond scope here - the intention is
currently to get everything onto the Namco Museum My Arcade Mini Player that
you need to launch RetroArch and play games with it, but beyond that you'll
have to find information elsewhere on what to do and how to properly use it.

## Pre-requisites

* A Namco Museum My Arcade Mini Player
* A USB-A to USB-micro data cable - NOT simply a charging cable!
* Android SDK Platform Tools [https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools]
* RetroArch for Android (32bit) [https://buildbot.libretro.com/stable/1.9.0/android/RetroArch_ra32.apk]
* RetroArch Cores for Android [https://buildbot.libretro.com/nightly/android/latest/armeabi-v7a/]
* ROMs of your choice to go with the cores

## Step-by-step Instructions

You only have to do this process once to install everything:

* Download the latest release [https://github.com/TerryGoodwin/NMMAMP-ExtraMuseum/releases]
* Unzip it wherever you want
* Install the Android SDK Platform Tools
 * Recommended location is `c:\android\platform-tools`
* Rename your RetroArch 32bit APK as `retroarch.apk` and put it inside the `retroarch`
* Put any cores you want to use into `retroarch\cores`
* Put any ROMs, BIOS files etc. you need for RetroArch into `GAME-EXTRA`
* Double-click the file `run_me_first_after_readme.bat`
* That's (hopefully) it!

You should then be able to use the controls on the device to navigate
RetroArch and play some games!

From now on, all you have to do is run `boot_retroarch.bat` while your
device is connected to your computer and it's turned on.

## Controls

Some notes about controls.

### Action buttons

The four actions buttons are mapped but with cerain systems they don't have
a great layout - but should be usable

### Reset

Does nonthing.

### Coin + Y

Bring up the RetroArch menu from inside a game being played in RetroArch
(this doesn't invoke RetroArch from anywhere else.)

### Common errors

#### Couldn't start ADB

Check you've installed the Android SDK Platform Tools where you think you
did. If you didn't install them to `c:\android\platform-tools` then you'll
need to change the path at the top of each .bat file by hand to reflect
reality.

#### Root failed

This could be for a couple of reasons:

* Windows couldn't figure out the drivers for the device - see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15721778/adb-no-devices-found and follow the answer by Ant√≥nio Almeida. On my Windows 10 machine I didn't have to do anything, but on my Windows 8.1 machine I had to do that extra step.
* Your USB cable isn't transmitting data, only charge - try a different cable!

## What else can I do?

### reboot_device.bat

Reboots the device and takes you back to the stock UI.

### boot_retroarch.bat

Boots into RetroArch from the stock experience.

### install_roms.bat

Re-copies the contents of `GAME-EXTRA` to your device. This is not a sync - if you delete ROMs locally and then run this, they won't be removed from your device.

### install_retroarch_cores.bat

Re-copies the contents of `retroarch\cores` to your device. This is not a sync - if you delete cores locally and then run this, they won't be removed from your device.

### install_retroarch_config.bat

If you want to make manual changes to the `retroarch.cfg` this is how you get them back on the device. NOTE! If you've made any changes ON the device, they won't be reflected here until you run...

### get_latest_retroarch_config.bat

Downloads `retroarch.cfg` from the device and places it at `retroarch\retroarch.new.cfg` so you can make new changes, then push them back to the device.

## To Do

A lot...

* Write a Java app to act as a launcher at boot, to allow the user to choose the stock experience or the Extra Museum without being tethered to a computer
* Write a Java app to act as a configurable frontend for ROM collections so you don't have to use RetroArch's menus
* Add a script to uninstall everything to go completely back to stock
* Add scripts to remove unwanted cores
* Add scripts to remove unwanted/all ROMs
* Add button mappings per core/system so they make more sense.
