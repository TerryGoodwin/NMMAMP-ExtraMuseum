# Namco Musem - My Arcade Mini Player - Extra Musem
Version 0.1.1.0

### What is this?
A set of Windows batch files to allow you to install and run RetroArch
(or technically any sensible/valid APK) on the Namco Museum My Arcade
Mini Player by tethering it to a Windows computer. Granting you an
Extra Museum, if you will.

Crucially, this provides a RetroArch configuration that allows you to
navigate the RetroArch frontend using the built-in controls of the
Namco Museum My Arcade Mini Player.

### What is this not?
A collection of ROMs or emulators - there's nothing included here except
scripts and an example configuration. So this does not currently include
a way to install anything to the Namco Museum My Arcade Mini Player and
let you run it without sending commands from a computer. Not yet.

This isn't a frontend (lavish or otherwise) for a new collection of
ROMs and emulators on the Namco Museum My Arcade Mini Player - yet.

Knowing how to use RetroArch is beyond scope here - the intention is
currently to get everything onto the Namco Museum My Arcade Mini Player
that you need to launch RetroArch and play games with it, but beyond
that you'll have to find information elsewhere on what to do and how to
properly use it.

## Pre-requisites
Here's what you'll need:

* A Namco Museum My Arcade Mini Player
* A USB-A to USB-micro data cable - NOT simply a charging cable!
* Android SDK Platform Tools [https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools]
* RetroArch for Android (32bit) [https://buildbot.libretro.com/stable/1.9.0/android/RetroArch_ra32.apk]
* RetroArch Cores for Android [https://buildbot.libretro.com/nightly/android/latest/armeabi-v7a/]
* ROMs of your choice to go with the cores

## Step-by-step Instructions
You only have to do this process once to install everything:

* Download the latest release [https://github.com/TerryGoodwin/NMMAMP-ExtraMuseum/releases]
* Unzip it wherever you want
* Install the Android SDK Platform Tools
 * Recommended location is `c:\android\platform-tools`
* Rename your RetroArch 32bit APK as `retroarch.apk` and put it in the `retroarch` folder
* Put any cores you want to use into `retroarch\cores`
* Put any ROMs, BIOS files etc. you need for RetroArch into `GAME-EXTRA`
* Double-click the file `run_me_first_after_readme.bat`
* That's (hopefully) it!
 
You should then be able to use the controls on the device to navigate
RetroArch and play some games!

From now on, all you have to do is run `boot_retroarch.bat` while your
device is connected to your computer and it's turned on.

## Controls
The biggest hurdle to getting this working was figuring out how to
translate the built-inc ontrols into something that RetroArch could
understand. Fortunately the stock software prints every button press
to the log, so I could see what button codes correspond with which input
- these have been translated into the `retroarch.cfg` included with the
scripts.

### Action buttons
The four actions buttons are mapped directly to the button IDs
internally, but with cerain systems they don't have a great layout - but should be usable.

### Reset
Does nonthing at this time - it is just a regular button so I will
probably remap the hotkey to this away from coin...

### Coin + Y
The coin button acts as the hotkey within RetroArch, so the usual
RetroArch combinations should work, but all I've really tested it with
is Y to bring up the RetroArch menu. (This doesn't invoke RetroArch
from anywhere else, such as the stock software, sorry!)

### Common errors

#### Couldn't start ADB
Check you've installed the Android SDK Platform Tools where you think
you did. If you didn't install them to `c:\android\platform-tools` then
you'll need to change the path at the top of each .bat file by hand to
reflect reality.

#### Root failed
This could be for a couple of reasons:

* Windows couldn't figure out the drivers for the device - see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15721778/adb-no-devices-found and follow the answer by Ant√≥nio Almeida. On my Windows 10 machine I didn't have to do anything, but on my Windows 8.1 machine I had to do that extra step.
* Your USB cable isn't transmitting data, only charge - try a different cable!

## What else can I do?

### boot_retroarch.bat
Boots into RetroArch from the stock experience.

### get_latest_retroarch_config.bat
Downloads `retroarch.cfg` from the device and places it at
`retroarch\retroarch.new.cfg` so you can make new changes, then push
them back to the device.

### install_retroarch.bat
Installs RetroArch APK from retroarch\retroarch.apk then copies over
the custom configuration file from retroarch\retroarch.cfg

### install_retroarch_config.bat
If you want to make manual changes to the `retroarch.cfg` this is how
you get them back on the device. NOTE! If you've made any changes ON
the device, they won't be reflected here until you run...

### install_retroarch_cores.bat
Re-copies the contents of `retroarch\cores` to your device. This is not
a sync - if you delete cores locally and then run this, they won't be
removed from your device.

### install_roms.bat
Re-copies the contents of `GAME-EXTRA` to your device. This is not a
sync - if you delete ROMs locally and then run this, they won't be
removed from your device.

### reboot_device.bat
Reboots the device and takes you back to the stock UI.

### remove_all.bat
Uninstalls everything from the device that's been put there by these
scripts

### remove_all_retroarch_cores.bat
After receiving confirmation, deletes all installed cores from the
device. Use `install_retroarch_cores.bat` to put some back.

### remove_all_roms.bat
After receiving confirmation, deletes all installed ROMs from the
device. Use `install_roms.bat` to put some back.

### remove_retroarch.bat
Uninstalls RetroArch and all it's related data, but not ROMs.

### remove_retroarch_cores.bat
Prints a list of currently installed cores, and allows you to type the
full file name of the core you wish to remove. Type `quit` `stop` or
`exit` to stop deleting.

### remove_roms.bat
Prints a list of currently installed ROMs, and allows you to type the
full file name of the ROM you wish to remove. Type `quit` `stop` or
`exit` to stop deleting.

## To Do
A lot...

* Write a Java app to act as a launcher at boot, to allow the user to choose the stock experience or the Extra Museum without being tethered to a computer
* Write a Java app to act as a configurable frontend for ROM collections so you don't have to use RetroArch's menus
* Add button mappings per core/system so they make more sense.
* Add scripts to allow you to install and uninstall any arbitrary APK
* Extend RetroArch core and ROM scripts to allow drag-and-drop of single files
